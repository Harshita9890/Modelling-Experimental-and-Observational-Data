# Modelling Experimental and Observational Data: 
The project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of a dataset with a primary focus on Alzheimer's disease. 
The analysis involves the application of sophisticated statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify trends, correlations, 
and forecasting models related to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease.
# Contents
1.Descriptive Analysis and Graphical Analysis: Utilizes descriptive statistics and graphical displays to explore key variables in the dataset.
2.Clustering Algorithm: Implements clustering algorithms, including k-means clustering, to identify possible groupings or subgroups within the data.                                                                   
3.Logistic Regression: Fits a logistic regression model to predict Alzheimer's diagnosis and evaluates its predictive ability.                                                                                         
4.Feature Selection Method and Conclusion: Applies Boruta feature selection to identify significant attributes and concludes the analysis.
